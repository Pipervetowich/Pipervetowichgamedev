Assignment 1:

The tutorial took me around 3 hours. I came across some things I missed which made it take longer.

Three Changes:

Games are not complete without sound, so I added background music. It took me like 10-15 mintues to figure it out. 

I added sound affects to the gun so it sounds like its shooting. It took me like 10-15 mins.

The game over screen seemd unfinshed without an option to play again so I added a restart button. I had some trouble so it took me like 30-45 mins.

Assignment 2:

It took me a really long time to do the assignment.

I added:

A timer that counts up and when you survive for 20 seconds, your character gets an extra gun.

When slimes die, they have a chance to drop a health potion and it heals 20 health points.

When you kill 50 slimes, the game ends and you win!
